# ButtonGrid
Infragistics XamDataGrid with "unbound" button column whose command is bound to view model command

I had a seemingly simple request:
* Infragistics XamDataGrid bound to an ObservableCollection of viewmodel objects
* A button on each row in the grid bound to an ICommand in the viewmodel

After hours of research I ended up with this.
